# VueJS To-do app

I am still learning VueJS and this app is a perfect way to get a good grasp on the basics. My plans include connecting the app to firebase and storing todos of every user, along with their username and chosen password. Of course, it will not be "supersecure", but it'll be somewhat usefull.
